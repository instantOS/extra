PKGBUILDS for instantOS packages

## build instructions

requires instantOS/instantTOOLS to be installed

### build all packages

`ibuild fullrepo`

this builds all pkgbuilds from source and also builds all AUR packages from the ./aurpackages file. 
This does not generate a package database nor does it publish anything

## binaries

built binaries for these are hosted over at [instantos.surge.sh](https://instantos.surge.sh)
